The course project, which was a group project included reading and analysing the research paper titled Contextual Modulation of value signals in reward and punishment lerning. Link-https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9096

We first replicated the experiment on PsychoPy, which was played by 15 participants and made a computational model ussing Reinforcement learning (Q-learning) which also played the same experiment and results obtained were compared and analysed using matplotlib.

We also made an extension of the same experiment by changing the reward and loss values. This experiment was played by 15 participants and the computational model. The results obtained were compared and analysed.
